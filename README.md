Resources to become a Software Engineer

_These books cannot be read as storybooks, at least from my point of view. Rather than trying to read cover to cover, you should instead try to go through the exercises they might contain. Trying to understand and seeking necessary help will do you a great favor in this journey of yours_

## [Composing Programs](http://www.composingprograms.com/)
This book focuses on the bigger picture when building out programs. It does not talk about syntax, but rather the basic constructs every engineer should know.
